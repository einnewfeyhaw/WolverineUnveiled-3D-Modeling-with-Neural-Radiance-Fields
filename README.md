# WolverineUnveiled-3D-Modeling-with-Neural-Radiance-Fields


## Overview

This project delves into the world of 3D modeling with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), showcasing the creation of a 3D model for Wolverine. The NeRF approach allows for highly detailed and realistic 3D reconstructions from a set of images.

## Features

- Utilizes Neural Radiance Fields for 3D modeling.
- Creates a detailed 3D model of Wolverine.
- Provides tools for visualization and exploration of the generated 3D model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/einnewfeyhaw/WolverineUnveiled-3D-Modeling-with-Neural-Radiance-Fields.git
